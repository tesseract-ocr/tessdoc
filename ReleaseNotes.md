* Reorganized Tesseract's source tree. All public headers are now placed in the `include/tesseract` directory.
* Refactored the Autotools build. It now uses non-recursive (auto)make.

# Tesseract release notes Dec 26 2019 - V4.1.1
* Added support for image or image list by URL. This feature is implemented using libcurl. Usage: `tesseract http://IMAGE_URL OUTPUT ...`
* Added the parameter `document_title` to set the title in OCR output files (hOCR, PDF, ALTO).
* Added the parameter `tessedit_do_invert`, which can speed up tesseract execution, when set to `false`.
* Added the parameter `pageseg_apply_music_mask` to allow disabling the music mask.
* Added ComposedBlock level to the ALTO renderer making it more in line with the hOCR renderer.
* Added an option to build tesseract with the sw build system and package manager. Building with cppan  is deprecated.
* Fixed more locale handling issues found since 4.1.0.
* Fixed a memory leak in text2image.
* Fixed potential bugs discovered by running UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.

# Tesseract release notes Jul 07 2019 - V4.1.0
  * Backward compatible release with 4.0.0  
  * Added a new output option formatted in the [ALTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALTO_(XML)) standard. Command line usage: `tesseract imagename outputbase alto`. This output is **experimental** and might be changed a bit before the next release.
  * Added new renders LSTMBox, WordStrBox to simplify training
  * Added character boxes in hOCR output.
  * Added Python training scripts (experimental) as alternative shell scripts.
  * [Fixed locale handling issue](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/331cc84d8d79). libtesseract now works with any locale.
  * Better support AVX / AVX2 / SSE.
  * Disable OpenMP support by default (see e.g. #1171, #1081).
  * Fix for bounding box problem.
  * Implemented support for whitelist/blacklist in LSTM engine.
  * Made user-words and user-patterns files work with the LSTM engine. [#2328](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/2328)
  * Improved CMake configuration.
  * Code modernization and improvements.
  * A lot of bug fixes.

# Tesseract release notes Oct 29 2018 - V4.0.0
  * **New OCR engine**
    * Added a new OCR engine that uses neural network system based on LSTMs, with major accuracy gains.
    * This includes new training tools for the LSTM OCR engine. A new model can be trained from scratch or by fine tuning an existing model.
    * Added trained data that includes LSTM models to [123 languages](Data-Files.md#updated-data-files-for-version-400-september-15-2017).
    * Added optional accelerated code paths for the LSTM recognizer:
      * Using OpenMP
      * Using SIMD: AVX2 / AVX / SSE4.1
    * Added a new parameter `lstm_choice_mode` that allows to include alternative symbol choices in the hOCR output.
  * **Other OCR engines**
    * The pattern matching OCR engine that was the primary OCR engine in previous versions is still available in this version.
    * Removed the 'Cube' OCR engine from the codebase. It was used for Hindi and for Arabic. The New LSTM engine performs much better, thus the  Cube engine was no longer needed.
  * **Updated build system**
    * Tesseract now uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
    * Added an option to compile Tesseract without the code of the legacy OCR engine.
  * **Updated requirements**
    * For building Tesseract from source code, a compiler with good C++ 11 support is required. See [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract) for a list of officially supported compilers.
    * Tesseract now requires Leptonica 1.74.0 or a higher version.
    * Update minimum required autoconf version to 2.63.
    * Training tools dependencies - Update minimum required versions: ICU 52.1, Pango 1.22.0.
  * **Bug fixes and enhancements**
    * Fixed many issues that triggered compiler warnings.
    * Fixed many issues reported by [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/tesseract-ocr) or [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/).
    * Fixes to trainingdata rendering.
    * Fixed damage to binary images when processing PDFs.
    * Don't trigger a deliberate segmentation fault for fatal errors in release code [(Commit 5338a5a8d)](
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/5338a5a8d5e4ebad).
    * Fixed some issues in OpenCL code. OpenCL now works for the legacy Tesseract OCR engine, but does not improve the performance. It is not implemented for the LSTM OCR engine.
    * Improved  multi-page TIFF handling.
    * Improvements to PDF rendering.
    * Added version information and improved help texts to the training tools.
    * Added faster version of log2().
    * Documented in `tesseract` man page the option to use an input text file which contains lists of images.
    * Made 'osd' the default traineddata when psm 0 is requested (currently this feature is only implemented in the command line interface, but not in the API).
    * Removed `tessedit_pageseg_mode 1`
from hocr, pdf, and tsv config files. The user should explicitly use `--psm 1` if that is desired [(Commit ecfee53ba)](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/ecfee53bac59e546).
    * The list of available languages and scripts is now sorted alphabetically.
    * Parameter `unlv_tilde_crunching` changed to `false`, because of default values cause issues (#948, #1449) in cases of unlv output in Tesseract 4.
    * Added parameter: `min_characters_to_try`.
  * **Misc.**
    * Reorganized Tesseract's source tree. Most sources are now below the `src` directory.
    * Added unit tests to the main repo. The unit tests require Git submodules and the code for training.
    * Removed obsolete code.
  * **Important notes**
    * The new LSTM engine still does not support all features from the old legacy engine (see [missing features](Planning.md#features-from-30x-which-are-missing-for-lstm)).
    * Tesseract now requires the so called "C" locale. This has mainly implications when Tesseract is used as a library from programming languages like Java or Python. The _locale_ stands for several settings which depend on a language (or language variant) or country. Some of those setting determine the classification of symbols (for example "Is this character a blank (space) character?") or the way how numbers are printed (for example "3.141" or "3,141"). The current Tesseract code implicitly expects some fixed settings, otherwise it fails. Therefore the code fails right at the beginning with an assertion if it cannot be sure that the settings work. This is not a problem with C or C++ programs which by default get a "C" locale with the right settings. All other use cases must currently make sure that they switch to the "C" locale before running Tesseract code. [**Fixed**](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/commit/331cc84d8d79) in version 4.1.0.

# Tesseract release notes Oct 21 2011 - V3.01
  * Thread-safety! Moved all critical globals and statics to members of the appropriate class. Tesseract is now thread-safe (multiple instances can be used in parallel in multiple threads.) with the minor exception that some control parameters are still global and affect all threads.
  * Added `Cube`, a new **experimental** recognizer for Arabic and Hindi. Cube can also be used in combination with normal Tesseract for a few other languages with an small improvement in accuracy at the cost of much lower speed. **There is no training module for Cube.**
  * `OcrEngineMode` in `Init` replaces `AccuracyVSpeed` to control cube.
  * Greatly improved segmentation search with consequent accuracy and speed improvements, especially for Chinese.
  * Added `PageIterator` and `ResultIterator` as cleaner ways to get the full results out of Tesseract, that are not currently provided by any of the `TessBaseAPI::Get*` methods. All other methods, such as the `ETEXT_STRUCT` in particular are deprecated and will be deleted in the future.
  * ApplyBoxes totally rewritten to make training easier. It can now cope with touching/overlapping training characters, and a new boxfile format allows word boxes instead of character boxes, BUT to use that you have to have already boostrapped the language with character boxes. "Cyclic dependency" on traineddata.
  * Auto orientation and script detection added to page layout analysis.
  * Deleted **lots** of dead code.
  * Fixxht module replaced with scalable data-driven module.
  * Output font characteristics accuracy improved.
  * Removed the double conversion at each classification.
  * Upgraded oldest structs to be classes and deprecated PBLOB.
  * Removed non-deterministic baseline fit.
  * Added fixed length dawgs for Chinese.
  * Handling of vertical text improved.
  * Handling of leader dots improved.
  * Table detection greatly improved.
  * Fixed a couple of memory leaks.
  * Fixed font labels on output text. (Not perfect, but a lot better than before.)
  * Cleanup and more bug fixes
  * Special treatments for Hindi.
  * Support for build in VS2010 with Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 (thanks to Michael Lutz)


# Tesseract release notes Sep 30 2010 - V3.00
  * Preparations for thread safety:
    * Changed TessBaseAPI methods to be non-static
    * Created a class hierarchy for the directories to hold instance data, and began moving code into the classes.
    * Moved thresholding code to a separate class.
  * Added major new page layout analysis module.
  * Added hOCR output.
  * Added Leptonica as main image I/O and handling. Currently optional, but in future releases linking with Leptonica will be mandatory.
  * Ambiguity table rewritten to allow definite replacements in place of fix\_quotes.
  * Added TessdataManager to combine data files into a single file.
  * Some dead code deleted.
  * VC++6 no longer supported. It can't cope with the use of templates.
  * Many more languages added.
  * Doxygenation of most of the function header comments.

# Tesseract release notes June 30 2009 - V2.04
  * Integrated patches for portability and to remove some of the "access" macros.
  * Removed dependence on lua from the viewer making it a **lot** faster. Also the viewer now compiles and works (on Linux.) Also works on windows via a pre-built ScrollView.jar.
  * Fixed the following issues: 1, 63, 67, 71, 76, 79, 81, 82, 84, 106, 108, 111, 112, 128, 129, 130, 133, 135, 142, 143, 145, 146, 147, 153, 154, 160, 165, 169, 170, 175, 177, 187, 192, 195, 199, 201, 205, 209.
  * This is the last version to support VC++6!
  * This may also be the last version to compile without Leptonica!
  * Windows version now outputs to stderr by default, fixing a lot of the problems with lack of visible meaningful error messages.

# Tesseract release notes April 22 2008 - V2.03
2.02 was unrunnable, due to a last-minute "simple" change.
2.03 fixes the problem.  
It also adds an include check for leptonica
to make it more usable.

# Tesseract release notes April 21 2008 - V2.02
  * Improvements to clustering, training and classifier.
  * Major internationalization improvements for large-character-set languages, eg Kannada.
  * Removed some compiler warnings.
  * Added multipage tiff support for training and running.
  * Updated graphics output to talk to new java-based viewer.
  * Added ability to save n-best lists.
  * Added Leptonica support for more file types.
  * Improved Init/End to make them safe.
  * Reduced memory use of dictionaries.
  * Added some new APIs to TessBaseAPI.
  * Fixed namespace collisions with jpeg library (INT32).
  * Portability fixes for Windows for new code.
  * Updates to autoconf system for new code.

# Tesseract release notes Aug 30, 2007 - V2.01
(See also release notes for 2.00 below for usage information)

No major functionality change. Just a bunch of bug fixes.
  * Fixed UTF8 input problems with box file reader.
  * Fixed various infinite loops and crashes in dawg code.
  * Removed include of config\_auto.h from host.h.
  * Added automatic wctype encoding to unicharset\_extractor.
  * Fixed dawg table too full error.
  * Removed svn files from tarball.
  * Added new functions to tessdll.
  * Increased maximum utf8 string in a classification result to 8.
  * Added new functionality to TessBaseAPI for Ocropus.

No new data files for the original 6 languages. Use the files from v2.00.
There are new data files for German Fraktur (deu-f) and Brazillian Portuguese (por).

**STOP PRESS** There is a minor bug in unicharset\_extractor. Since this is only applicable to training, the main tarball is fine unless you need to run training, in which case, overwrite your unicharset\_extractor.cpp and unicharset\_extractor.exe with the ones in tesseract-2.01.patch1.tar.gz.

# Tesseract release notes Jul 18, 2007 - V2.00
(See also release notes for 1.04 below for additional usage information)

First release of the International version.
This version recognizes the following languages:
  * English - eng
  * French  - fra
  * Italian - ita
  * German  - deu
  * Spanish - spa
  * Dutch   - nld

The language codes follow ISO 639-2. The default language is English.
To recognize another language:
```
tesseract inputimage outputbase -l langcode
```

To train on a new language, see [TrainingTesseract2](TrainingTesseract2.md).
More languages will be appearing over time.

List of changes in this release:
  * Converted internal character handling to UTF8.
  * Trained with 6 languages.
  * Added unicharset\_extractor, wordlist2dawg.
  * Added boxfile creation mode.
  * Added UNLV regression test capability.
  * Fixed problems with copyright and registered symbols.
  * Fixed extern "C" declarations problem.
  * Made some improvements to consistency of accuracy across platforms.
  * Added VC++ express support.

**Warning:** Tesseract 2.00 has undergone more compatibility testing than any previous version. There have even been fixes to make the accuracy more consistent across platforms. Having said that, there have been many changes to the code, and portability may have been broken, so 64 bit and Mac platforms may not work or even build as well as before.


# Tesseract release notes May 15, 2007 - V1.04

Tesseract development is now done with Subversion and hosted at code.google.com (Previously we used CVS as a VCS and sourceforge.net for hosting).

**Windows users only**

Added a dll interface for windows. Thanks to Glen at Jetsoft for contributing
this. To use the dll, include tessdll.h, import tessdll.lib and put tessdll.dll
somewhere where the system can find it. There is also a small dlltest program
to test the dll. Run with:
```
dlltest phototest.tif phototest.txt
```
It will output the text from phototest.tif with bounding box information.

**New for Windows**

The distribution now includes tesseract.exe and tessdll.dll
which **might** work out of the box! There are no guarantees as you need
VC++6 versions of MFC and CRT (at least) for it to work. (Batteries not
included, and certainly no installshield.)

**Important note for anyone building with make: i.e. anyone except devstudio
users**

This release includes new standardization for the data directory. To enable
Tesseract to find its data files, you must either:
```
./configure
make
make install
```
to move the data files to the standard place, or:
```
export TESSDATA_PREFIX="directory in which your tessdata resides/"
```
(or equivalent) in your .profile or whatever or setenv to set the environment
variable. Note that the directory must end in a /

**HAVING tesseract and tessdata IN THE SAME DIRECTORY DOES NOT WORK ANY MORE.**

**All users**

Fixed a bunch of name collisions - mostly with STL.  
Made some preliminary changes for unicode compatibility. Includes a new data
file (unicharset) and renaming of the other data files to eng. to support
different languages.  
There are also several other minor bug fixes and **portability improvements**
for 64 bit, the latest visual studio compiler etc.  

**Thanks to all who have contributed these fixes.**

NOTE: This is likely to be the last English-only release!
Apologies in advance to non-windows users for bloating the distribution with
windows executables. This will probably get fixed in the next release with
the multi-language capability, since that will also bloat the distribution.

# Tesseract release notes February 03, 2007 - V1.03
  * Added mftraining and cntraining.
  * Added baseapi with adaptive thresholding for grey and color.
  * Fixed many memory leaks.
  * Fixed several bugs including lack of use of adaptive classifier.
  * Added ifdefs to eliminate graphics code and add embedded platform support.
