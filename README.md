## Introduction

Tesseract is an open source [text recognition (OCR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) Engine, available under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
* Major version 5 is the current stable version and started with release [5.0.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.0.0) on November 30, 2021.
* Newer minor versions and bugfix versions are available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/).
* Latest source code is available from [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/main).
Open issues can be found in [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues),
and [planning documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Planning.html).

Tesseract can be used directly via [command line](Command-Line-Usage.md), or (for programmers) by using an [API](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/baseapi.h) to extract printed text from images. It supports a [wide variety of languages](Data-Files-in-different-versions.md). Tesseract doesn't have a built-in GUI, but there are several available from the [3rdParty](User-Projects-–-3rdParty.md) page. External tools, wrappers and training projects for Tesseract are listed under [AddOns](AddOns.md).

Tesseract can be used in your own project, under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0.](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) It has a fully featured API, and can be compiled for a variety of targets including Android and the iPhone. See the [3rdParty](User-Projects-–-3rdParty.md) and [AddOns](AddOns.md) pages for samples of what has been done with it.

If you have a question, first read the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/),
particularly the **[FAQ](FAQ.md)** to see if your problem is addressed there.
If not, search the [Issues List](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues),
[Tesseract user forum](https://groups.google.com/group/tesseract-ocr),
and if you still can't find what you need, please ask your question in
[Tesseract user forum Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/tesseract-ocr).

Tesseract is free software, so if you want to pitch in and help, please do!
If you find a bug and fix it yourself, the best thing to do is to attach the patch to your bug report in the [Issues List](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues).

## Tesseract with LSTM

Tesseract **4.0** added a new OCR engine based on LSTM neural networks. It works well on x86/Linux with official Language Model data available for [100+ languages and 35+ scripts](Data-Files-in-different-versions.md). See [4.0x-Changelog](tess4/4.0x-Changelog.md) for more details.

## 5.x.x

### Source Code

Tesseract **5.x.x** source code is available in the `main` branch of the [repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
The `main` branch is using `5.0.0` semver versioning because C++ code modernization caused API
incompatibility with 4.x release.

### Binaries

Binaries are available from:
- [Ubuntu - tesseract-ocr-devel PPA](https://launchpad.net/~alex-p/+archive/ubuntu/tesseract-ocr-devel)
- [Debian - notesalexp.org](https://notesalexp.org/tesseract-ocr/#tesseract_5.x)
- [Windows - Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

### Traineddata Files

For detailed information about the different types of models, see [Data Files](Data-Files.md).

Model files for version `4.00` are available from [tessdata tagged 4.00](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/releases/tag/4.00). It has models from November 2016. The individual language file links are available from the following link.
- [tessdata 4.00 November 2016](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc/blob/master/Data-Files.md#data-files-for-version-400-november-29-2016)

Model files for version `4.0.0` and later are available from [tessdata tagged 4.0.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/releases/tag/4.0.0).
It has legacy models from September 2017 that have been updated with Integer versions
of `tessdata_best` LSTM models. This set of traineddata files has support for both
the legacy recognizer with `--oem 0` and for LSTM models with `--oem 1`.
These models are available from the following Github repo.
- [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata)

Two more sets of `official` traineddata, trained at Google, are made available in
the following Github repos. These do not have the legacy models and only have
LSTM models usable with `--oem 1`.

- [tessdata_best](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best)
- [tessdata_fast](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast)

Language model traineddata files same as listed above for version `4.0.0` can be used
with Tesseract `5.x.x`. These are available from:
- [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata)
- [tessdata_best](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best)
- [tessdata_fast](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast)
