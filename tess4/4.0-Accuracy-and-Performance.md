See testing section in [DAS Tutorial 2016](

Big test in Google Data Center (Hindi?)

| Engine	  | Total char errors  | Word Recall Errors  | Word Precision Errors  | Walltime  | CPUtime* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tess 3.04	| 13.9	| 30	| 31.2	| 3.0	| 2.8 |
| Cube	| 15.1	| 29.5	| 30.7	| 3.4	| 3.1 |
| Tess+Cube	| 11.0	| 24.2	| 25.4	| 5.7	| 5.3 | 
| LSTM	| 7.6	| 20.9	| 20.8	| 1.5	| 2.5 | 

Note in the above table that LSTM is faster than Tess 3.04 (without adding cube) in both wall time and CPU time! For wall time by a factor of 2.

Median of three results from test on HP Z420 on a single Hindi page.

| Test Mode | Real | User | 
|---|---|---|
| Original (cube + tess)         | 7.6  | 7.3 | 
| Base Tess                      | 2.9  | 2.6 | 
| Cube                           | 5.4  | 4.9 | 
| LSTM With OpenMP+AVX           | 1.8  | 3.8 | 
| LSTM No OpenMP with AVX        | 2.7  | 2.4 | 
| LSTM No OpenMP with SSE        | 3.1  | 2.7 | 
| LSTM No OpenMP no SIMD at all  | 4.6  | 4.1 | 

---------------

> My first test with a simple screenshot gave  significant better results with LSTM, but needed 16 minutes CPU time  (instead of 9 seconds) with a debug build of Tesseract (-O0). A release  build (-O2) needs 17 seconds with LSTM, 4 seconds without for the same  image.

The slow speed with debug is to be expected. The new code is much more memory intensive, so it is a lot slower on debug (also openmp is turned off by choice on debug). The optimized build speed sounds about right for Latin-based languages. It
is the complex scripts that will run faster relative to base Tesseract.
